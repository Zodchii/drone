The drone should have a dynamic number of engines.
He should be able to receive commands from a remote control:
● Up
● Down
● Left
● Right
● Faster
● Slower
● Take picture
● Enter “follow the leader” mode (see below)
● Exit “follow the leader” mode
In “follow the leader” mode the drone will input distance and height, and will keep this distance
and height from the control.
